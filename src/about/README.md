Adding an upload image feature to your project can always be  a stressful process.

From targeting the image provided by the user in the input field, to converting it to the right format,
manipulating the DOM down to ouputing the image to the browers in the right quality and size.
It's a whole stressful journey.

Just like every plugin is a software component  that adds a specific feature to an existing  computer program, the **image-upload plugin** solves the hassle of having to create an image upload feature each time in a new project.


Just by installing  the **image-upload plugin**  and setting up a few lines of code, you have your image-upload feature all set up.
